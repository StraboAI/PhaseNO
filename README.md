  Plot the predicted probabilities and picks for all stations.

## 5. Using with BPMF

[BPMF](https://github.com/ebeauce/Seismic_BPMF) is a python package for autmoated seismic event detection, location, and template matching that relies on backprojection of "features" created from raw seismic traces. A recently published [high-resolution catalog of seismicity leading up to the 2019 Ridgecrest sequence](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL104375) used [Phasenet](https://github.com/AI4EPS/PhaseNet)-derived phase probability features with BPMF. To use PhaseNO phase probabilities for input into the beamforming algorithm, install the package in your environment (see above) and replace the [Phasenet-specific code](https://ebeauce.github.io/Seismic_BPMF/tutorial/notebooks/5_backprojection.html) with the following code:

```python
from PhaseNO import PhaseNOPredictor

ml_detector = PhaseNOPredictor(net, graph_type, k, radius)
```

PhaseNO uses a graph neural network algorithm, and therefore represents the seismic stations as a graph. The init arguments to `PhaseNOPredictor` specify that graph.

- `net`:  BPMF Network object containing, among other things, the seismic station locations.

- `graph_type`: str|None, either `knn` or `radius` for a k-nearest neighbors graph or a distance based graph, respectively. `None` for a fully connected graph. A fully connected graph can be very slow for a moderate to large number of stations.

- `k`: int, if a knn graph, the number of neighbors for each station.

- `radius`: numeric, if a radius graph, the nearest neighbor radius for each station.
